This project shows a simple web page deployed with heroku. I fancified the page a little bit, but it's nothing _too_ fancy

## Technical Achievements
- **Serving a stylesheet to the website from the server**

### Design Achievements
- **CSS Gradients and Animation**: Shown in `fancify.css`, the code sets the background of the text to an undulating gradient, from blue to orange and back again
